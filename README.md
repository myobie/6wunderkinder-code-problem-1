The first 6Wunderkinder code problem is to fetch the latest 100 tweets
related to 6Wunderkinder and print them out.

I plan to use `lein` to generate a project (so, sadly there will be a
folder in this folder) and go from there. I'll also try to keep a log of
what I learn here. I'm reading the tutorial provided by `lein help
tutorial`.
